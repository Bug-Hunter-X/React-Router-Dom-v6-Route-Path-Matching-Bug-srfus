# React Router Dom v6 Route Path Matching Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using React Router Dom v6: incorrect path matching leading to unexpected component rendering or navigation failures.  The issue stems from improperly configured routes, especially when dealing with nested routes or dynamic segments.  The solution provided addresses this by clarifying route definitions and ensuring accurate matching.

## Problem

The original `App.js` contains a simple routing setup. However, due to potential issues in defining routes (e.g., missing or incorrect path specifications, conflicts between routes), the application might not navigate correctly or render the expected components.

## Solution

The `AppSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation of routing, addressing the path matching issue.  The solution ensures that routes are clearly defined, preventing conflicts and providing accurate path matching to components.  This guarantees that navigation works as intended.
